<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>With an initial background in Mechanical Engineering, I found my path leading towards computing, driven by my curiosity for its technological potential. Currently pursuing a degree in Computer Engineering, I immerse myself in an environment where computing intersects with my passion for materials science and renewable energy.

 <p>My experiences as a teacher, particularly in subjects like Game Programming, Design and Modeling, and Database, have enhanced my communication skills and technical proficiency. As a QA Tester, I utilize a diverse range of languages and tools, including Angular, CSS, Javascript, C#, React, Postgres, HTML, Selenium, and AWS/Azure. I play a pivotal role in testing, prototyping, and developing systems and websites for the Special Coordination of Information Technology, contributing to the excellence and effectiveness of its computational projects.</p>
